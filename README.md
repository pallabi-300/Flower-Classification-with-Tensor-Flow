# Flower Classification with TensorFlow

This project demonstrates a flower classification model using TensorFlow. The model is trained on a dataset containing 3670 images of 5 different types of flowers and classified into 5 classes.

# Dataset

The dataset used for training the model consists of 3670 images of flowers, categorized into the following classes:
1. Rose
2. Daisy
3. Sunflowers
4. Tulip
5. Dandelion

# Model Architecture

The model is built using TensorFlow and follows a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The network architecture is defined in the `flower_classification.py` file.
